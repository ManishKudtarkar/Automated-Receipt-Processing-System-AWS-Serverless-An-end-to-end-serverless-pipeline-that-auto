🚀 Automated Receipt Processing System (AWS Serverless)

An end-to-end serverless pipeline that automatically processes receipt PDFs uploaded to an S3 bucket, extracts key information, and sends structured data via email — eliminating manual effort and improving efficiency.

📌 Overview

This project automates the process of handling receipts by:

Uploading receipt PDFs to an S3 bucket
Triggering AWS Lambda for processing
Extracting key details (amount, vendor, date)
Sending extracted data directly to your email

💡 Built to solve real-world problems in expense tracking and workflow automation.
